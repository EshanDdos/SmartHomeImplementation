# SmartHomeImplementation

A smart home is an advantageous home setup where all home appliances and gadgets can be automatically controlled remotely from any web associated place in the world via smartphone or computer. Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology that allow user to make a smart home to operate electronic gadgets and appliances through cell phone or computer. In this project, A smart home has been designed and presented using newly launched CISCO packet tracer-version 7.2 which included different smart object used for home automation such as smart window, smart fan, smart light, smart door, smart garage door, lawn sprinkler, fire sprinkler etc and different sensors. To governance these smart objects and sensors, Home Gateway and microcontroller (MCU-PT)-Single Board Computer(SBC) has been used, since it give  programming environment for occupying smart object attached to it and give controlling methods by registering these smart device to Home Gateway respectively. Registration server is to be store all of the configuration and recognize all these devices so it could take action. When something happens registration server response quickly. After all of the IoT gadgets, sensors and appliances are linked to the home network wired or wirelessly and registered with the registration server, anyone will be capable to manage the IoT devices at home or away from home through the registration server.
